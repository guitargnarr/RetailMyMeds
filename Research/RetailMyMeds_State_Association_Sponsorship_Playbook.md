## 1. Independent Pharmacy Density by State (Top 15)

The most recent comprehensive state-level data comes from NCBI/Medicaid (SK&A Healthcare Information Solutions), supplemented by 2025 NCPA Digest national figures (18,960 independent locations nationwide, ~36% of all retail pharmacies). The PCMA/Quest Analytics 2026 data confirms 67 net new independent pharmacies from 2025 to 2026 nationally.

**Ranked by % of pharmacies that are independent:**

| Rank | State | Independent | Total Retail | % Independent | Population Context |
|------|-------|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | North Dakota | 140 | 170 | 82.4% | Small state, highest density |
| 2 | Wisconsin* | 371 | 150* | 71.2%* | *Data anomaly in source |
| 3 | Montana | 136 | 229 | 59.4% | Rural, high reliance on independents |
| 4 | Oklahoma | 481 | 850 | 56.6% | Large independent base |
| 5 | Hawaii | 96 | 171 | 56.1% | Island market, limited chains |
| 6 | South Dakota | 104 | 184 | 56.5% | Small state, high density |
| 7 | Nebraska | 237 | 429 | 55.2% | Rural Midwest, strong independents |
| 8 | Mississippi | 423 | 767 | 55.1% | Large independent count |
| 9 | Alaska | 48 | 93 | 51.6% | Remote, limited chain access |
| 10 | Kansas | 306 | 589 | 51.9% | Midwest, strong independent tradition |
| 11 | Louisiana | 512 | 1,013 | 50.5% | High absolute count |
| 12 | Kentucky | 493 | 1,002 | 49.2% | Appalachian, neighbor to WV |
| 13 | Iowa | 350 | 716 | 48.9% | Rural Midwest |
| 14 | Alabama | 583 | 1,229 | 47.4% | Large independent count |
| 15 | New York | 1,978 | 4,131 | 47.9% | Highest absolute count |

**Note:** These figures are from the most recent publicly available state-by-state dataset. Current numbers trend slightly lower nationally but the *relative rankings* among states remain consistent. The full 2025 NCPA Digest (behind paywall/membership) contains updated state-level data.

**Priority Tiers for Outreach:**
- **Tier 1 (Highest fit -- rural, high % independent, similar to WV):** North Dakota, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Mississippi, Oklahoma
- **Tier 2 (Strong fit -- moderate size, high % independent):** Kansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Iowa, Alabama
- **Tier 3 (Volume play -- large absolute counts):** New York, Texas, California, Florida, Pennsylvania

## 2. WVIPA Baseline (The Model to Replicate)

### Organization Profile
- **Full Name:** West Virginia Independent Pharmacy Association (WVIPA)
- **Website:** https://www.wvipa.org/
- **Founded:** 2016
- **Executive Director:** Matt Walker
- **President:** Michael Rudge (Mutual Drug)
- **VP:** Terri Doss (Man Pharmacy, Harts Pharmacy, Oceana Pharmacy, Chapmanville Pharmacy)
- **Secretary:** Aaron Smarr (Mountaineer Drug)
- **Address:** 2017 Quarrier St, Charleston, WV 25311
- **Phone:** 304-654-4214
- **WV Independent Pharmacies:** ~187 (40.1% of 466 total retail)

### RetailMyMeds Sponsorship at WVIPA
- RetailMyMeds is listed as a **general sponsor** (no tiered system visible on WVIPA site)
- WVIPA has a flat sponsor structure with 7 current sponsors: GRX Marketing, Kelestan Pharmacy Supplies, Mutual Drug, RetailMyMeds, NCPA, Marshall University School of Pharmacy, WV Pharmacists Association
- Sponsors receive: logo on sponsors page, company description, link to website
- WVIPA does not publish sponsorship pricing on its website
- The association does not appear to hold a formal annual trade show/convention (advocacy-focused model)

### What Makes This Work
- WVIPA is a small, advocacy-focused association (founded 2016)
- Tight-knit membership of independent pharmacy owners
- Direct access to decision-makers (owners, not employees)
- Sponsorship cost is likely modest ($1,000-$3,000 range based on organization size)
- Sponsors get direct credibility with the independent pharmacy community

## 11. ROI Framework

**At $275/month per pharmacy:**
- 1 pharmacy signup = $3,300/year revenue
- A $2,500 state sponsorship that yields 3 signups = $9,900/year (4x ROI)
- A $5,000 NCPA presence that yields 10 signups = $33,000/year (6.6x ROI)

**Break-even per sponsorship:**
- $1,000 sponsorship = need 1 pharmacy (4 months to break even)
- $2,500 sponsorship = need 1 pharmacy (10 months to break even)
- $5,000 sponsorship = need 2 pharmacies (10 months to break even)
- $10,000 sponsorship = need 4 pharmacies (10 months to break even)

**Total estimated budget for Phase 1-3 (2026):**
- 10 state associations at avg $2,500 = $25,000
- 1 national (NCPA) at $10,000 = $10,000
- 1 GPO/wholesale event at $5,000 = $5,000
- **Total: ~$40,000**
