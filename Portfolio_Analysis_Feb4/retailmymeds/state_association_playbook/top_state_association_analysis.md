## 1. Introduction

This document provides an analysis of the top state pharmacy associations ranked by independent pharmacy density. This analysis is a key component of the State Association Replication Playbook for RetailMyMeds, designed to inform a targeted outreach and sponsorship strategy.

## 2. Top States by Independent Pharmacy Density

Based on 2007 data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the following states have the highest density of independent pharmacies as a percentage of total retail pharmacies. While the data is from 2007, it provides a valuable starting point for identifying states with a strong independent pharmacy presence.

| Rank | State | Independent Pharmacy Density (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | North Dakota | 82.35% |
| 2 | Montana | 59.39% |
| 3 | Oklahoma | 56.59% |
| 4 | South Dakota | 56.52% |
| 5 | Mississippi | 55.15% |

*Note: Wisconsin was excluded from this list due to anomalous data in the source report.*

## 3. Analysis and Recommendations

The states with the highest independent pharmacy density represent the most attractive targets for RetailMyMeds' state association sponsorship strategy. These states have a strong and active independent pharmacy community, making them more likely to be receptive to a solution that addresses their specific financial challenges.

We recommend a phased approach to outreach, beginning with the top three states: **North Dakota, Montana, and Oklahoma**. The goal is to secure sponsorships and speaking opportunities at their respective state association conferences in 2026.

## 4. Next Steps

The next steps in this playbook will be to develop a sponsorship tier structure, a conference calendar matrix, and outreach templates to support the engagement with these target state associations.
