# MFP Crisis Response Brief: The Independent Pharmacy's Guide to the Medicare Maximum Fair Price Program

**For:** Independent Pharmacy Owners and Operators
**From:** RetailMyMeds
**Date:** February 4, 2026

## The Challenge: A Perfect Storm for Pharmacy Cash Flow

The Medicare Maximum Fair Price (MFP) program, which took effect on **January 1, 2026**, represents a fundamental shift in drug pricing and a significant threat to the financial viability of independent pharmacies. The program's phased implementation, with a second and third cycle of negotiated drugs on the horizon, will only intensify the cash flow pressure on pharmacies.

## The MFP Program: A Three-Cycle Impact

*   **Cycle 1 (Effective Jan 1, 2026):** The first 10 negotiated drug prices are now in effect.
*   **Cycle 2 (September 2026):** The scope of the second cycle will be finalized, with an additional 15 drugs subject to negotiation, effective January 1, 2027.
*   **Cycle 3 (June 2026):** The third cycle will be initiated, with another 15 drugs, including the first-ever Part B drugs, to be negotiated, effective January 1, 2028.

This multi-cycle rollout creates a cumulative and intensifying cash flow crunch for pharmacies, as the number of drugs with lower, negotiated prices grows over time.
