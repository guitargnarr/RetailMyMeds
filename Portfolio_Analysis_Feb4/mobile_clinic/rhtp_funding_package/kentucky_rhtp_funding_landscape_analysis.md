# Kentucky RHTP Funding Landscape Analysis

**Prepared for:** Kevin McCarron
**Prepared by:** Matthew Scott
**Date:** February 4, 2026

## 1. Overview of the RHTP Funding

Kentucky has been awarded **$212.9 million** as part of the federal Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) for the fiscal years 2026-2030 [1]. This funding is a segment of a larger **$50 billion national initiative** aimed at addressing significant healthcare challenges in rural communities across the United States [2]. The Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH), operating under the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS), is the designated lead agency for the program's implementation [2].

## 2. Program Administration and Disbursement

The DPH will form a new 20-person "A3 Team" to manage the RHTP initiatives, ensure fiscal accountability, and foster public-private partnerships to sustain the program's impact beyond the initial five-year grant period [2].

While the exact disbursement mechanisms are yet to be detailed, the program's application narrative suggests that funds will be allocated to subrecipients to carry out the initiatives [3]. This indicates a competitive application or Request for Proposal (RFP) process is likely for providers seeking to become sub-grant awardees or pilot sites [2]. Interested parties are advised to monitor for the official program launch, anticipated in **early 2026**, for specific details on the application process [2].

## 3. Priority Areas for Funding

Kentucky's RHTP application outlines five integrated care innovation models designed to address the state's most pressing rural health challenges:

| Initiative Title | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care Innovation** | Establishes local hub-and-spoke models focused on preventing and managing obesity and diabetes through integrated nutrition, physical activity, and digital self-management tools [1]. |
| **PoWERing Maternal and Infant Health** | Utilizes telehealth-enabled, community-based maternal care teams to expand prenatal and postpartum services, particularly in maternity care deserts and high-risk regions [1]. |
| **Rapid Response to Recovery** | Provides mobile crisis response, telepsychiatry, and stabilization services (EmPATH model) to connect individuals to community-based behavioral health and recovery supports [1] [3]. |
| **Rooted in Health: Rural Dental Access** | Expands dental hygiene training, externships, and the use of portable or tele-dental clinics to improve access to preventive oral health services [1] [3]. |
| **Crisis to Care: Integrated EMS Response** | Enhances pre-hospital care and trauma coordination by implementing treat-in-place protocols, advanced workforce training, and improved data connectivity [1]. |

## 4. Key Decision-Makers and Stakeholders
