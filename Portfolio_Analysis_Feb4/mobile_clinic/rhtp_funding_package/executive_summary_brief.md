**To:** Kevin McCarron
**From:** Matthew Scott
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Subject:** Urgent Opportunity to Secure RHTP Funding for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest

## 1. The Opportunity

Kentucky's **$212.9 million** allocation from the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) presents an immediate and significant opportunity for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest. The program's priorities, including mobile crisis response and behavioral health expansion, are in direct alignment with our core competencies. This funding represents a critical pathway to scale our operations and deepen our impact across the Commonwealth.

## 2. The Deliverable: A Ready-to-Submit Funding Proposal

This package contains a comprehensive and ready-to-submit funding proposal designed to position Mobile Clinic as the ideal partner for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS). The package includes:

*   **Kentucky RHTP Funding Landscape Analysis:** A detailed overview of the program, its priorities, and the key stakeholders.
*   **Positioning Document:** A compelling narrative that highlights our proven operational track record and strategic partnership with Baptist Health.
*   **Decision-Maker Contact Matrix:** A targeted list of key contacts within CHFS and other relevant agencies.
*   **Application Checklist & Timeline:** A step-by-step guide to ensure a timely and successful submission.

## 3. The Urgency

The RHTP funding window is expected to open in **early 2026**. It is imperative that we are prepared to submit our proposal as soon as the application process is announced. This proactive approach will give us a significant first-mover advantage and increase our likelihood of securing a substantial portion of the available funds.

## 4. Next Steps

I recommend that we immediately begin to socialize this proposal with the key decision-makers identified in the contact matrix. By proactively engaging with these stakeholders, we can build relationships, gather additional intelligence, and further strengthen our position as the partner of choice for the RHTP.
