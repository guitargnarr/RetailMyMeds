## Subject: Partnership Opportunity to Deploy Mobile Health Services for the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)

## 1. Introduction

Mobile Clinic by OnRequest, in partnership with Baptist Health, presents a unique and immediate opportunity to advance the goals of Kentucky's Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). With a proven operational track record and existing infrastructure, Mobile Clinic is perfectly positioned to address the RHTP's priority areas, including mobile crisis response, behavioral health expansion, and addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDoH).

## 2. Alignment with RHTP Priority Areas

Mobile Clinic's service model directly aligns with the key priorities of the RHTP. Our mobile units are equipped to provide a range of services, including primary care, behavioral health screenings, and referrals to community resources, making us an ideal partner for the following initiatives:

*   **Rapid Response to Recovery:** Our mobile clinics can be deployed as part of a mobile crisis response team, providing on-site behavioral health support and connecting individuals with community-based recovery services.
*   **School-Based Behavioral Health:** We have an established presence in K-12 schools and can rapidly expand our services to address the critical shortage of school counselors in many Kentucky districts.
*   **Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care Innovation:** Our mobile units can serve as spokes in the hub-and-spoke model, bringing chronic care management and preventative services directly to underserved communities.

## 3. Proven Delivery Capability: The Baptist Health Partnership

Our partnership with Baptist Health provides a strong foundation for delivering high-quality, reliable mobile health services. This collaboration has enabled us to establish a **five-day-a-week operational track record**, demonstrating our ability to consistently provide care to communities in need. The Baptist Health partnership provides clinical oversight, quality assurance, and a direct link to a major health system, ensuring a seamless continuum of care for patients.

## 4. Immediate Deployment and Scalability

Mobile Clinic by OnRequest is not a concept; it is an active, operational service. We have the vehicles, the staff, and the experience to immediately begin serving communities as part of the RHTP. Our model is designed for scalability, and with the support of the RHTP, we can rapidly expand our fleet and our reach to serve a larger geographic area and a greater number of Kentuckians.

## 5. Conclusion

Mobile Clinic by OnRequest offers a turnkey solution for the CHFS to achieve the ambitious goals of the RHTP. Our proven operational model, strong partnership with Baptist Health, and direct alignment with the program's priorities make us an ideal partner for this transformative initiative. We are prepared to begin work immediately and are confident in our ability to make a significant and lasting impact on the health and well-being of rural Kentuckians.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss this partnership further and to demonstrate how Mobile Clinic by OnRequest can be a key asset in the successful implementation of the Rural Health Transformation Program.
