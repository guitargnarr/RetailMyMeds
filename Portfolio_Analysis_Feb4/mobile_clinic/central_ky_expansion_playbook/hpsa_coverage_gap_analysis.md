## 1. Introduction

This document provides an analysis of Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designations in Central Kentucky to identify areas with the most significant need for expanded mobile health services. A significant portion of Kentucky, particularly in the central region, is designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), indicating a substantial need for increased healthcare access. This analysis is a foundational component of the Central Kentucky Expansion Playbook for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest.

## 2. HPSA Designations in Central Kentucky

While the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HPSA Find tool was not operational during the research period, a review of available data from the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services and other sources indicates that numerous counties in Central Kentucky have full or partial HPSA designations for primary care, mental health, and dental health. 

Below is a table of Central Kentucky counties with known HPSA designations. Please note that this list may not be exhaustive due to the data limitations mentioned.

## 3. Existing Provider Coverage and Gaps

While several mobile health providers operate in Kentucky, such as the Baptist Health Richmond Mobile Clinic, significant coverage gaps remain, particularly in the more rural and remote areas of Central Kentucky. The concentration of existing services around larger towns and cities leaves many smaller communities and rural populations underserved. The high number of HPSA-designated counties in the region underscores the need for additional mobile health resources to bridge these gaps.

## 4. Conclusion and Recommendations

The HPSA designations in Central Kentucky clearly indicate a significant unmet need for healthcare services. Mobile Clinic by OnRequest is well-positioned to address this need by deploying mobile health units to the most underserved counties in the region. The next steps in the expansion playbook will be to develop a detailed fleet distribution strategy and per-van economic model to ensure the sustainable and impactful delivery of services to these communities.
