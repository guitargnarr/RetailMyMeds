## 1. Introduction

This document provides an analysis of the significant gap in school-based mental health services in Kentucky. The findings highlight a critical need for additional resources and support for students across the state, presenting a clear opportunity for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest to expand its services and become a key partner in addressing this challenge.

## 2. School Counselor Shortage

A 2024 news report revealed a significant shortage of school counselors in Kentucky. Key findings from the report include:

*   **8.8% of Kentucky schools** do not have a certified school counselor.
*   **46.4% of schools** exceed the state's target student-to-counselor ratio of 250:1.

This data underscores a long-standing issue. A 2019 report from the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission found an average student-to-counselor ratio of **457.8 to 1**, nearly double the recommendation from the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) of 250:1. The Kentucky School Counselor Association (KSCA) is actively advocating for increased state funding to address this critical shortage.

## 3. National Legislative Context

The need for enhanced school-based mental health services is a national issue. In 2025, **75 bills were passed across 29 states** to bolster mental health support in schools. This legislative trend indicates a growing recognition of the importance of addressing student mental health and creates a favorable environment for initiatives like the one proposed for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest.

## 4. Opportunity for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest

The significant gap in school-based mental health services in Kentucky presents a clear opportunity for Mobile Clinic by OnRequest to expand its impact. By partnering with school districts, Mobile Clinic can provide much-needed behavioral health services to students, particularly in districts with the most critical shortages. The dual funding opportunity presented by the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) and school district budgets provides a viable financial model for this service line expansion.
