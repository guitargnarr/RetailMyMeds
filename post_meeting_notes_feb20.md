## Meeting Structure

Kevin presented the full asset suite. Matthew played support (backup demos, technical questions). Arica brought two team members -- Amy and Delaney -- on camera to see the work.

Kevin framed the meeting as "RMM 2.0" -- Arica's term for the next phase. He walked through a 9-item agenda covering research, strategy, landing pages, scorecard, Intel Hub, and outreach lists.

## What Was Shown

1. **Research & strategy methodology** -- 33,185 pharmacies, 6 federal data sources, scoring/grading system
2. **GLP-1 landing page** -- aggressive, data-backed messaging on reimbursement losses
3. **MFP landing page** -- cash-flow burden from Maximum Fair Prices program
4. **DIR Fee landing page** -- PBM fee squeeze positioning
5. **10-question scorecard/survey** -- lead capture form for pharmacy qualification
6. **Sample scorecards** -- 3 PDF examples of personalized pharmacy reports
7. **Intel Hub dashboard** -- rmm-intel-hub.onrender.com (national overview, state drill-down, pharmacy search, CSV export)
8. **Forecasting tool** -- rmm-pharmacy-tool.vercel.app (4-field calculator)
9. **State outreach lists** -- 51 CSVs, CRM-ready

## Arica's Key Statements

### GLP-1 Reality
- Drugs cost $800-$1,200/mo acquisition. Under-reimbursed by PBMs across the board.
- One pharmacy owner in Delaware lost **$6,000 on a single GLP-1 drug** from under-reimbursed claims.
- Margins: 3-5% gross at best, sometimes ~1%. "The juice is not worth the squeeze. Why tie up $1,200 in acquisition when you make 10 bucks?"
- 1 in 8 Americans currently using/trying GLP-1s, expected to increase.
- Direct-to-consumer programs bypassing PBMs are promising, but consumers resist paying cash -- they expect insurance to cover everything.

### MFP Program (New Intelligence)
- **6 weeks old**, remits just starting to come in.
- Pharmacy fronts full cost (e.g., $500). PBM reimburses half ($250). Manufacturer supposed to rebate the rest ($300).
- **Manufacturers are NOT rebating the correct amounts.** Pharmacies are not being made whole.
- Reimbursement wait: **60 days** vs. normal 2 weeks. Massive cash-flow burden.
- Expanding: 10 drugs now, 10 more next year, 10 more in 2028, topping out at 50-60 drugs.
- "If they don't correct the reimbursement lags and deficits, I really think that it's going to be catastrophic for the majority of pharmacies."

### Cash Flow
- **#1 issue even before GLP-1 and MFP entered the picture.** Those programs "pour salt in the wound."

### RMM Market Position
- ~19,000 independent pharmacies nationally.
- RMM has touched ~1,000-1,500 so far. "We're not as well known as we need to be."
- **High churn rate** -- Arica is frustrated: "I don't understand how to make this program any more needed."
- Current growth channels: social media and word of mouth only.
- Her stance: pharmacies operating in pure dispense model have a "very grim" future.
- RMM's positioning: short-term cash-flow stabilizer so pharmacies can diversify and become "PBM-proof."

### Reaction to Assets
- **Landing pages:** When Kevin asked if the tone was too strong/alarming: "No, I like it."
- **Scorecard/lead capture:** "I think it's really good to do something like this to capture leads and to really make the owners think about where their money's going."
- **Two-tier model request:** Free scorecard for lead capture, then a **paid** in-depth evaluation using actual dispensing data (brand-level drug analysis, acquisition costs, net profit, custom plan).
- **No data accuracy concerns** raised on Intel Hub. Treated as directionally sound for targeting and qualification.

## What Arica Wants That We Don't Have Yet

1. **Paid deep-dive tier** -- pharmacy-specific analysis using actual dispensing data, not state-level estimates. The scorecard is the free hook; paid evaluation is where real value + revenue lives.
2. **Dispensing data intake fields** -- months of dispensing data, brand-name drugs dispensed, acquisition costs, net profit.
3. **Conference follow-up cross-reference** -- she introduced RMM to "a lot of new faces" at the recent conference. Wants to cross-reference attendee list against the database.

## Action Items

### Matthew
1. **Refine scorecard indicators** -- incorporate Arica's language and priorities: GLP-1 acquisition vs. reimbursement, margin %, MFP cash-flow lag, rebate shortfalls. Use her phrases: "cash-flow burden," "PBM-proof," "the juice is not worth the squeeze."
2. **Design paid deep-dive tier** -- spec the intake (actual dispensing data: brand drugs, acquisition costs, net profit) and output (pharmacy-specific plan with RMM ROI case). This is the revenue layer above the free scorecard.
3. **Update MFP intelligence** -- 60-day reimbursement lag, manufacturer rebate shortfalls, expansion timeline (10 drugs/year to 50-60 total). Incorporate into landing pages, Intel Hub context, and scorecard.
4. **Conference follow-up lists** -- be ready to cross-reference attendee data against the database when Arica provides it.
5. **Share Intel Hub credentials** with Amy and Delaney (Arica's team members).

### Kevin
- Wix Studio integration of qualification form (his build, his timeline)
- Branding the landing pages to RMM visual identity

### Arica
- Provide conference attendee list for cross-referencing
- Provide existing customer list for re-engagement analysis (the "fastest win" -- not explicitly requested yet but discussed in prep)

## Key Quotes (Verbatim)

- "The juice is not worth the squeeze. Why tie up $1,200 in acquisition when you make 10 bucks?" -- Arica on GLP-1 margins
- "I don't understand how to make this program any more needed" -- Arica on churn
- "If they don't correct the reimbursement lags and deficits, I really think that it's going to be catastrophic for the majority of pharmacies" -- Arica on MFP
- "No, I like it" -- Arica on aggressive landing page tone
- "I think it's really good to do something like this to capture leads and to really make the owners think about where their money's going" -- Arica on scorecard
- "We want them to pay for that more in depth evaluation where we can actually look at their individual dispensing data and come up with a plan" -- Arica on two-tier model
- "Their future is very grim" -- Arica on pharmacies still in pure dispense model
- "The number one issue is cash flow, before these two things even came into play" -- Arica on pharmacy economics

## Strategic Implications

1. **GLP-1 loss as a qualifier is validated.** Arica confirmed it's a real, acute pain point. The $37/fill NCPA estimate is conservative vs. reality ($6k loss on a single drug).
2. **MFP is a second qualifying dimension** we should add to scoring. 60-day cash-flow lag + rebate shortfalls = compounding crisis. This wasn't in the original score model.
3. **Two-tier commercial model** changes the product architecture. Free scorecard (lead gen) -> paid evaluation (revenue). Design the paid tier before the next meeting.
4. **Churn reduction** is as important as new acquisition. Arica's frustration with churn means the Intel Hub could serve re-engagement (show existing customers their market conditions) -- this was in our prep but didn't come up explicitly.
5. **Arica brought her team.** Amy and Delaney seeing the work means buy-in is broadening beyond Arica alone. Credential sharing should follow promptly.
