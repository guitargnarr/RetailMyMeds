# Independent Pharmacy Economics Briefing
**Prepared: February 18, 2026 | Meeting Preparation Document**

## 1. DIR Fees (Direct and Indirect Remuneration)

### What They Are
DIR fees are post-point-of-sale price concessions that Medicare Part D plan sponsors and their PBMs charge pharmacies. They originated as "performance-based" adjustments tied to quality metrics (medication adherence, generic dispensing rates, etc.), but in practice became a mechanism for PBMs to claw back reimbursement months after a prescription was filled.

### How They Worked (Pre-2024)
- Pharmacy fills a Medicare Part D prescription and receives a reimbursement at point of sale
- 6-12 months later, the PBM retroactively assesses a DIR fee, clawing back a portion of that reimbursement
- Pharmacies could not predict the clawback amount at time of dispensing, making it impossible to know if a script was profitable when filled
- DIR fees were based on opaque "performance metrics" defined and measured by the PBMs themselves

### Scale of the Problem
- **2010:** Total DIR was $8.6 billion; pharmacy DIR fees were negligible
- **2019:** Pharmacy DIR fees hit a record **$9.1 billion** (18% of total Medicare Part D rebates)
- **2020:** CMS reported DIR fee usage had exploded by **107,400%** between 2010 and 2020
- **2022:** Total DIR ballooned to **$75.3 billion** (includes manufacturer rebates + pharmacy fees)
- **2023:** Pharmacy DIR assessments grew to **3.7% of total prescription sales**, up from <0.5% in 2015

### CMS DIR Fee Reform (January 1, 2024)
**Yes, the reform was implemented.** CMS finalized the rule on April 29, 2022 (Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes), with DIR fee provisions taking effect January 1, 2024.

**What changed:**
- PBMs can no longer retroactively assess DIR fees
- All price concessions must be reflected at the point of sale as part of the "final negotiated price"
- This eliminates the clawback mechanism and gives pharmacies immediate visibility into reimbursement

**What actually happened -- the "DIR Hangover":**
- PBMs responded by **severely reducing point-of-sale reimbursement rates**, often below acquisition cost
- The reform eliminated retroactive clawbacks but PBMs simply front-loaded the same reductions
- During Q1-Q2 2024, pharmacies faced a double hit: paying off 2023 DIR assessments while simultaneously receiving lower 2024 reimbursements
- **99% of independent pharmacies** reported lower reimbursements at point of sale after the reform (NCPA survey)
- **Result:** The reform was a structural improvement (predictability) but not a financial improvement -- PBMs adapted to preserve their margins

## 2. PBM Reimbursement Trends (2024-2026)

### Current State: Declining for Independents
Reimbursement rates for independent pharmacies have continued to decline through this period. The PBMs' response to DIR reform was to reduce point-of-sale reimbursement to levels frequently **below the pharmacy's acquisition cost** (the price the pharmacy pays its wholesaler for the drug).

### Key Data Points
- **NCPA 2024 Digest:** Independent pharmacy saw a **10-year low in gross profits** in 2023, with gross margin falling to **19.7%** (lowest in the report's 10-year lookback)
- **NCPA 2025 Digest:** 2024 brought a **10-year high in cost of goods**, a **10-year high in average annual sales**, and a **10-year low in gross profits** -- pharmacies selling more but keeping less
- **Independent pharmacy marketplace:** $94.9B in 2023, grew to **$103B in 2024**, yet profitability declined
- PBMs reimburse at roughly **96% of WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost) or lower** for many drugs, meaning pharmacies receive less than what they paid

### The Big Three PBMs
| PBM | Parent Company | Market Share |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| CVS Caremark | CVS Health | ~33% |
| Express Scripts | Cigna Group | ~24% |
| OptumRx | UnitedHealth Group | ~23% |

These three **collectively control ~80% of all U.S. prescriptions**.

### FTC Enforcement Actions
- **September 20, 2024:** FTC filed an administrative complaint against all three PBMs, alleging anticompetitive rebating practices that artificially inflated insulin costs
- **February 4, 2026:** FTC secured a **landmark settlement with Express Scripts** requiring fundamental business practice changes, expected to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for drugs like insulin by **up to $7 billion over 10 years**
  - Express Scripts must stop preferring high-list-price drugs on formularies when cheaper equivalents exist
  - Must delink compensation from manufacturer list prices
- **Ongoing:** FTC lawsuit against CVS Caremark and OptumRx continues

### Major Legislative Action: Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2026
Signed by President Trump on **February 3, 2026** -- the first major federal PBM reform in decades.

**Key provisions:**
1. **100% rebate pass-through** -- PBMs must remit 100% of rebates, fees, and discounts from manufacturers to their plan clients (quarterly, within 90 days)
2. **Bona fide service fees only (2028)** -- PBM compensation in Medicare Part D must be flat-dollar, fair-market-value fees unrelated to drug list prices
3. **Any-willing-pharmacy (2029)** -- Any pharmacy that meets "reasonable and relevant" terms must be allowed into Part D networks, with protections for "essential retail pharmacies" in underserved areas
4. **Transparency reporting** -- PBMs must provide semiannual reporting on net drug spending, rebates, spread pricing, and self-dealing with affiliated pharmacies
5. **CMS enforcement authority** -- CMS can define and enforce contract terms and track pharmacy reimbursement trends

### The December 2024 Near-Miss
These reforms were originally included in the December 2024 spending bill but were stripped after Elon Musk publicly opposed the bill on social media (December 15, 2024), calling it too long with too much "pork." Ironically, Musk tweeted five days later: "What is a 'pharmacy benefit manager?'" -- admitting he didn't know what PBMs were when he torpedoed the reform. At least **326 pharmacies closed** in the ~10 weeks between December 19, 2024 (when reform was killed) and the law's eventual passage on February 3, 2026.

## 3. Net-Negative (Underwater) Prescriptions

### Industry Terminology
- **Underwater reimbursement** -- when a pharmacy is paid less than its acquisition cost for a drug
- **Below-NADAC** -- reimbursement below the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (a CMS benchmark)
- **Net-negative scripts** -- prescriptions where the total reimbursement (after all fees) results in a loss
- **Clawbacks** -- retroactive fee reductions (the pre-2024 DIR mechanism)

### How Common Are They?
- **Before DIR fee reform:** 8% of generic claims were underwater at point of sale, but **after DIR fees were applied, 35% became underwater** for certain Medicare Part D plans
- **February 2024 NCPA survey:** More than **50% of pharmacists** said they lose money on **at least 30% of prescriptions they fill**
- **January 2025 NCPA survey:** **29.2% of independent pharmacists** reported being paid below NADAC on **50% or more** of their Medicare Part D prescriptions

### Drug Classes Most Affected

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (the worst offender):**
- **95% of pharmacists** who dispense GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, etc.) report **losing money** on every fill
- Average loss: more than **$37 per 30-day supply**
- **14%** of independent pharmacies have stopped stocking GLP-1s entirely
- **59%** are considering dropping them
- PBM reimbursement averages **96% of WAC or lower**, below wholesale acquisition cost

**Other affected categories:**
- **Specialty medications** -- high-cost drugs with enormous cash outlay; one pharmacist reported losing $200 on a single $20,000 specialty claim
- **Generic medications** -- the bread-and-butter of independent pharmacy, but increasingly underwater due to aggressive MAC (Maximum Allowable Cost) pricing by PBMs
- **Medicare Negotiated Price Program drugs** -- 51% of independents are considering not stocking drugs in the Medicare negotiation program; a third won't carry them at all

### The Structural Problem
PBMs set reimbursement rates using MAC lists (for generics) and formulary-driven pricing (for brands). These rates are not transparent, can change without notice, and pharmacies have limited appeal rights. The vertical integration of PBMs with insurance companies AND retail chains (CVS Caremark owns CVS Pharmacy; OptumRx is owned by UnitedHealth which owns a pharmacy network) creates a conflict of interest where the PBM can steer patients to its own pharmacies while underpaying independents.

## 4. Mail-Order Pharmacy Coordination

### Major Mail-Order Players

| Provider | Parent / Affiliation | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| CVS Caremark Mail Service | CVS Health | 1.5B+ claims annually across all channels |
| Express Scripts Pharmacy | Cigna Group | Largest standalone PBM-owned mail order |
| OptumRx Home Delivery | UnitedHealth Group | Integrated with UHC insurance |
| Amazon Pharmacy / PillPack | Amazon | Highest customer satisfaction (759/1000); acquired PillPack 2018 |
| Costco Mail Order | Costco | #2 in customer satisfaction overall |
| Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs | Independent (PBC) | Cost-plus model (drug cost + 15% markup + $5 shipping) |
| Alto Pharmacy | Independent | Tech-forward, same-day delivery focus |

### Market Scale
- **2024:** Over **1.2 billion prescriptions** processed through mail-order services globally
- **U.S. growth:** 23% year-over-year increase in mail-order utilization
- **Market size:** $66.5B in 2023, projected to reach **$180.5B by 2033** (CAGR 10.5%)

### Do Independents Redirect Unprofitable Scripts to Mail Order?
This is **not a common or standard strategy** today. The current landscape:

1. **Most pharmacies absorb the losses** -- they fill underwater scripts to retain the patient relationship and the profitable scripts that come with it. Refusing to fill drives the patient away entirely.
2. **Some pharmacies decline to stock certain drugs** -- 14% have stopped stocking GLP-1s; up to 90% say they won't participate in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. This is "passive redirection" -- the patient must go elsewhere, which may include mail order.
3. **State-level protections exist** -- Some states (e.g., Oklahoma) allow pharmacies to legally decline to dispense if reimbursement is below acquisition cost.
4. **PBMs actively steer TO mail order** -- PBMs incentivize patients to use mail order (often to their own affiliated mail-order pharmacies) through lower copays and mandatory mail-order provisions. This is the PBM steering patients away from independents, not the other way around.
5. **Cost Plus Drugs partnership model** -- Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs launched an **Affiliate Pharmacy Network** in 2023, allowing independents to offer Cost Plus pricing in-store via the "Team Cuban Card." This provides a workaround to PBM pricing for cash-pay patients.

### Strategic Implication for RetailMyMeds
A system that helps independent pharmacies identify which scripts are underwater and provides an intelligent referral pathway (to mail order, cost-plus alternatives, or patient assistance programs) would be **novel, not commoditized**. Most pharmacies lack the real-time data tools to make per-script profitability decisions at the counter. The industry term is "claim adjudication analysis" or "reimbursement optimization," but no widely adopted tool exists for independents to systematically route unprofitable fills.

## 5. NCPA (National Community Pharmacists Association)

### Current Positions

**On DIR Fees:**
- Supported the CMS DIR reform but has been vocal that PBMs circumvented the intent by lowering point-of-sale reimbursement
- Advocates for CMS to set minimum reimbursement floors above NADAC

**On PBM Reform:**
- Called the February 3, 2026 PBM Reform Act "the first major PBM reform in decades"
- Key NCPA-supported provisions: any-willing-pharmacy, rebate pass-through, bona fide service fees, CMS enforcement authority
- Now pushing for expansion to **Medicaid, TRICARE, and Federal Employee Health Benefit Program** (the 2026 law focused on Medicare Part D)
- Organizing Congressional Pharmacy Fly-In events to maintain reform momentum

**On Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program:**
- January 2025: NCPA told CMS that **a third of independent pharmacies won't carry negotiated-price drugs**, and **60% more are considering dropping out**, because PBMs are expected to reimburse below cost on those drugs too

**On Independent Pharmacy Survival:**
- Frames the issue as a public health crisis, not just an economic one
- Emphasizes that pharmacies closing in rural and underserved communities create "pharmacy deserts"
- Advocates for state-level protections (many states have enacted PBM transparency and fair-reimbursement laws)

### Key NCPA Data & Reports

**NCPA 2024 Digest (October 2024):**
- 18,984 independent pharmacy locations (June 2024), down from 19,432 the prior year
- $94.9B marketplace in 2023
- Gross profit margin: **19.7%** (10-year low)

## 6. Independent Pharmacy Closure Trends

### The Numbers

| Period | Data Point | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| June 2023 | ~19,432 independent pharmacy locations | NCPA 2024 Digest |
| June 2024 | 18,984 locations (-448 from prior year, ~1.2/day) | NCPA 2024 Digest |
| July 2025 | 18,960 locations (-24 from June 2024) | NCPA 2025 Digest |
| Jan 2024 - Oct 2024 | 2,275 total pharmacy closures (all types) in first 9 months | Drug Topics |
| Jan 2024 - Feb 2026 | **3,179+ total pharmacy closures** (~5% of all U.S. pharmacies) | Economic Liberties Project |
| Dec 19, 2024 - Feb 2026 | **326 pharmacies closed** (237 independent) in ~10 weeks after PBM reform was first killed | Economic Liberties Project |

### Context: It's Not Just Independents
The closure wave is hitting chains too:
- **Rite Aid:** Filed for bankruptcy (October 2023), closed hundreds of stores
- **CVS:** Announced closure of ~900 stores over 3 years (2022-2025)
- **Walgreens:** Announced closure of ~1,200 "underperforming" U.S. stores (2024-2027)
- But independent closures are disproportionately devastating because they serve rural and underserved communities where chains don't operate

### Health Affairs Research (2024)
A peer-reviewed study in Health Affairs found that more U.S. pharmacies closed than opened between 2018 and 2021, with **independent pharmacies and those in Black and Latino communities** most at risk of closure.

### The Outlook
**Near-term (2026-2027):** Mixed signals.
- **Positive:** The February 2026 PBM Reform Act is the most significant regulatory win for independents in decades. If implemented as written, the any-willing-pharmacy provision (2029) and bona fide service fee requirement (2028) could stabilize the economics.
- **Negative:** Implementation timelines are 2-3 years out. PBMs will lobby for weak enforcement and may find workarounds (as they did with DIR reform in 2024). Pharmacy closures continue in the interim.
- **PCMA counterpoint:** The PBM trade association (PCMA) claims independent pharmacies actually increased by 321 stores (+1.4%) between 2015-2025, and grew again into 2026. This likely reflects new openings partially offsetting closures, but the net trend is negative on a location basis per NCPA data.

**Long-term structural factors:**
- Continued growth of mail-order and digital pharmacy (10.5% CAGR)
- PBM vertical integration (PBM + insurer + pharmacy chain under one corporate umbrella)
- 30% of independents consistently report considering closure each year
- ~50% report worsening financial conditions year over year

## Summary: Key Talking Points for the Meeting

1. **The DIR reform "worked" structurally but not financially.** Retroactive clawbacks ended January 2024, but PBMs responded by crushing point-of-sale reimbursement. 99% of independents saw lower reimbursements post-reform.

2. **Half of independent pharmacies lose money on 30%+ of their scripts.** GLP-1s are the most extreme case (95% of pharmacists lose ~$37/fill), but generics and specialty drugs are also frequently underwater.

3. **The February 2026 PBM Reform Act is historic but not yet operational.** Key provisions (bona fide service fees, any-willing-pharmacy) don't take effect until 2028-2029. PBMs will adapt.

4. **3,179+ pharmacies have closed since January 2024.** The U.S. is losing roughly one independent pharmacy per day. Rural and minority communities are hit hardest.

5. **Independent pharmacy is a $103B marketplace operating at a 10-year low in gross profits.** Revenue is up but margins are being squeezed to the breaking point.

6. **Mail-order is growing at 10.5% CAGR** and is dominated by PBM-affiliated entities. No widely adopted tool exists for independents to systematically identify and manage underwater prescriptions.

7. **The FTC is actively pursuing the Big Three PBMs.** Express Scripts settled (Feb 2026); CVS Caremark and OptumRx cases are ongoing. The regulatory environment is shifting in favor of pharmacy access and transparency.
