Kevin,

Great meeting today. Arica and the team gave us a lot to work with. Here's where things stand and what I'm working on next.

**Intel Hub Login**

The dashboard is now behind authentication. Share these with Arica, Amy, and Delaney:

- URL: https://rmm-intel-hub.onrender.com
- Username: rmm
- Password: (shared via secure channel)

Note: Running on Render Starter plan (always-on). No cold start delays.

**Action Items (Matthew)**

1. Refining the scorecard indicators based on Arica's feedback -- incorporating GLP-1 acquisition vs. reimbursement, margin percentages, and MFP cash-flow lag as qualifying factors. Using her language directly.

2. Designing the paid deep-dive tier she described -- the step beyond the free scorecard where we analyze actual dispensing data (brand-level drugs, acquisition costs, net profit) and produce a pharmacy-specific plan. I'll have a spec for this.

3. Updating the MFP content across landing pages and the Intel Hub. The 60-day reimbursement lag, manufacturer rebate shortfalls, and the expansion timeline (10 drugs/year scaling to 50-60) are new data points we should be showing.

4. Ready to cross-reference conference attendee data against the database whenever Arica sends that list over.

**Your Side**

- Branding the landing pages to RMM visual identity (whenever you're ready to pick that up)
- Wix/Velo integration of the qualification form (your timeline)

**Recording**

Otter shared the transcript to both of us and Arica. I'll use it as the reference for everything above.

Let me know if anything needs to shift priority.

Matthew
